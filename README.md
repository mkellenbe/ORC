# ORC (Open-source Regional-specific lCoe model)

This open-source code is used for estimating the Levelized Cost of Electricity for wind turbines dependent on their technical and location-specific data. It is based on the LandBOSSE and Wind Turbine Design Cost and Scaling model from NREL. 

Links to the used models are here found here:

LandBOSSE: https://github.com/WISDEM/LandBOSSE

WTDCSM: https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/TopFarm2/-/blob/master/topfarm/cost_models/economic_models/turbine_cost.py?ref_type=heads

The model's tools and their functionality are described shortly in the ORC instructions.ipynb Jupyter notebook. 

BEFORE FIRST USE IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHECK IF ALL DIRECTORIES ARE AS THEY SHOULD BE AND IF THE FILES ARE ACCESSED RIGHT!!
